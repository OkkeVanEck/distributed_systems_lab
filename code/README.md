# Code
This folder contains all the code needed for this project. All code is
categorized and distributed over folders to keep everything organized. Naming 
conventions can be found in the READMEs within the folders. The structure is 
composed of the folders:

| Folder | Description |
|:------:| ----------- |
| algorithms | Algorithms contains _.py_ files with the code that executes a part of the system. |
| classes | Classes contains _.py_ files which each define a data structure. |
| experiments | Experiments contains _.py_ files that run a total simulation on the machine(s). <br/> The functions within the files are directly evoked by jobs.  |
| helpers | Helpers contains _.py_ files that are neither algorithms, classes or experiments. <br/> These files contain groups of functions that fall within a specific category. <br/> For example _visualizer.py_ could contain all functions that create visualizations.
