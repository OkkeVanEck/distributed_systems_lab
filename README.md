# Distributed Systems Lab

## Structure of the project
The project is composed of multiple folders to separate code, data and jobs. 
Each of the folders can contain sub-folders to categorize internal files from 
each other. The main structure of the project is divided into:

| Folder | Description |
|:------:| ----------- |
| code | Code contains all files that can be exicuted as a part of a simulation, or the simulation itself. |
| data | Data contains all input files required by the simulations. |
| figures | Figures contain all generated figures that need to be stored.
| jobs | Jobs contains all the SLURM jobs that execute simulations on the DAS-5. |
